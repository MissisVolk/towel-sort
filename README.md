# towel-sort
Task "Towel Sort"

Your task is to implement the so-called 'towel sort' algorithm.

towelSort function should expect matrix of any shape for example:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ],
]
Following matrix should be 'sorted' to:
 [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9 ]
Write your code in `src/index.js. All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.
